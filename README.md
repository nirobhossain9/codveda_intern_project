## 📖 Project Overview

This internship project involved hands-on application of data analytics techniques to solve real-world problems using Python. The tasks covered data cleaning, EDA, regression, clustering, classification, NLP, and dashboard creation.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statsmodels
- TextBlob, nltk, WordCloud
- Power BI / Tableau (for dashboards)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 🔹 Level 1 – Basic Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using mean imputation
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized date and categorical formats

### ✅ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics (mean, median, std)
- Histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrix

### ✅ Task 3: Basic Data Visualization
- Bar plots, line plots, and scatter plots
- Custom labels and saved plots as images

---

## 🔸 Level 2 – Intermediate Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Regression Analysis
- Built a linear regression model (California housing dataset)
- Evaluated using R² and MSE metrics

### ✅ Task 2: Time Series Analysis
- Generated time-series data and visualized trend and seasonality
- Decomposed series and applied moving average

### ✅ Task 3: K-Means Clustering
- Standardized features and applied elbow method
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots

---

## 🔺 Level 3 – Advanced Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Predictive Modeling (Classification)
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier on the Iris dataset
- Evaluated using classification report (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Tuned model using GridSearchCV

### ✅ Task 2: Dashboard with Power BI/Tableau
- Created an interactive sales dashboard with slicers and filters
- Included KPIs, bar charts, and regional maps
- 👉 **[View Dashboard Here]([https://your-dashboard-link.com](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZDE1NWU1ZmYtZDIyNy00ZTRiLWEwMGYtMDFlMTE4MjlhYjRmIiwidCI6ImYzZDA5MDA5LWI2ZjItNDI1OS05ZWJjLTkyNzRkNTMxNDc0MSIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D))**

### ✅ Task 3: NLP – Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzed 200 customer reviews using TextBlob
- Classified reviews into Positive, Neutral, and Negative
- Visualized sentiment distribution and word cloud
